INTRODUCTION

Greater London, as we see today, is a large, culturally diverse, metropolitan county comprising of 32 boroughs
and the City of London. The economic and social conditions of London in the mid-1960s gave rise to critical
pressures that helped shape the history of boroughs. The entity of Greater London with its 32 boroughs was
created on 1st April 1965. The 12 interior boroughs fall under Inner London and the outer ring around Inner
London comprises of the 20 Outer London boroughs. Inner and Outer London boroughs vary in terms of
population, area, and economic activity.
The first census in the UK was taken in 1801 and conducted every 10 years since then, with evolving data
collection methodologies. Census data is essential to recognize trends and decide on the correct allocation of
resources. It can be very valuable to enable the efficient use of public funds for setting up educational institutions,
healthcare centres, supermarkets, transport facilities, and other public amenities in different regions.
The rich data available in the census can be used to gain insights into the relation between demographics and
economic change. In particular, we can examine whether demographic factors can explain trends observed in
employment types. For this purpose, I have taken census data from the years 1991, 2001, 2011 to study the
population changes in the 32 boroughs of Greater London. Combining with the data for employment and
migration, the relation between these indicators can be determined. Further, recognizing trends in this data allowed
for the prediction of how these numbers will change over the next 30-year period.

HYPOTHESIS

Demographic trends in a region, such as population growth and migration, can predict trends in employment types.

DATASET

The London Datastore provides open and freely accessible datasets about parameters in London such as housing,
health, education, crime, and environmental indicators. Historical census dataset of around 2MB was downloaded
from the datastore, which contains year-wise information extracted from different census tables. Multiple
worksheets containing information on a range of indicators like population count, migrants, economic activity,
and industry of employed residents have been extracted and used for the analysis. The data has been filtered for
the years 1991, 2001 and 2011. Since the smallest geographical division used for the indicators is borough, the
data can be readily used.

CONCLUSION

This study revealed patterns in population growth of the 32 boroughs in Greater London based on the census data
from 1991, 2001 and 2011. The trend showed a gradual reduction in the fraction of people with full-time
employment, with more people opting for part-time or self-employment roles. This is likely to be a continuing
trend in the future with the rise of the gig-economy and flexible employment roles. Traditional permanent jobs
are unlikely to fulfil the requirements of a growing population, and new industries are rising up to provide
innovative job opportunities. In support of this idea, this study revealed a negative correlation between population
size and number of full-time jobs in outer London. On the other hand, a positive correlation was found between
migrant count and full-time jobs in inner London boroughs, highlighting the role of immigration in building
industries in the urban centre of the UK. Further, a regression model was built to predict trends in population
growth, migration, and employment types in these boroughs in 2021, 2031 and 2041. This reinforced the
diminishing fraction of full-time jobs against a rising population. This should allow for constructive, data-driven
decisions to be made for the future planning of Greater London boroughs and the development of the entire area.
